! HTML Forms & Tables
! (Notes will be only new knowledge or parts I'd like to reinforce)

* Tables should only be used today to layout tabular content.
? Trivia: In the older days of the internet, tables were sometimes used to design entire webpages.
Tables are generally, in my experience and in my instructor's, a pain due to the staggering amount of elements needed to construct them.
Here's a refresher of the general structure:
-->

<table>
  <thead> <!-- Mostly Semantic, denotes the start and end of the header of a table. -->
    <tr>  <!--Table row - Groups content together in a row -->
      <th>Table Row Header #1</th> <!-- Defines a header, placed in a row -->
      <th>Table Row Header #2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody> <!-- Again, semantic, but contains the main content of our table. -->
    <tr>
      <td>Content</td> <!-- Table Data -->
      <td>Content</td> <!-- Other Related Table Data -->
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<!--
! Colspan and Rowspan
* These attributes let us designate specific spacing for columns and rows.


! HTML Forms
* The <form> element itself is basically a shell or container; it doesn't have any visual effect.
* The action attribute specifies WHERE the form data should be sent.
* The method specifies which HTTP method should be used (i.e. GET, POST, etc.)

! Inputs & Labels
As of writing this, there are over 20+ types of inputs we can choose from to include in a form, radically changing the behavior of an input's behavior and/or appearance.

* Labels do way more than just providing context for our forms and inputs, they link elements together and it's especially important for accessibility.
* It also makes the label clickable!

? Inputs take an id attribute and labels take a for attribute.
! These two should match together.

? The name attribute is what we send to the server for processing and should be on every input you use.
