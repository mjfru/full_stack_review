<!-- 
! Intro to HTML
! (Notes will be only new knowledge or parts I'd like to reinforce)
* The overall goal of HTML is to - mark it up -, make our language readable for an internet browser for interpretation.
It was originally created in the early days of the internet to show segmentation and structure of academic research papers.
* Reminders: 
?   Do not use headings to merely change font-size.
?   Only 1 <h1></h1> heading per page.
?   Move sequentially through <h2> - <h6>, do not jump, for example, from <h1> to <h6> without using h2, h3, h4, h5 first.

* Reminder about anchor <a></a> tags:
?   To link pages that are together in the same project folder, the href will be 'href="page_name.html"'.
