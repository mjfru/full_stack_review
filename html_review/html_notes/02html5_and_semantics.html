? HTML5 refers to the latest evolution of the standard the defines HTML, representing two different concepts:
  - It's a new version of HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors
  - It's also a larger set of technologies, allowing the building of more diverse and powerful web applications.

! A random assortment of elements:
  - <hr> - Horizonal row, creates a line between elements; 'a break from thematic elements'
  - <br> - Line break, used for 'ungrouping' a piece of content, like a poem in a <p> tag, to be on different lines.
  - <sup> / <sub> - Superscript (like citations) and subscript (like scientific element abbreviations / fractions).
      <p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p> -- H2O

? Trivia: <div> is short for 'The Content Division Element'.
