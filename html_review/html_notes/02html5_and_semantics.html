! HTML5, Semantics, & More
! (Notes will be only new knowledge or parts I'd like to reinforce)

? HTML5 refers to the latest evolution of the standard the defines HTML, representing two different concepts:
  - It's a new version of HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors
  - It's also a larger set of technologies, allowing the building of more diverse and powerful web applications.

! A random assortment of elements:
  - <hr> - Horizonal row, creates a line between elements; 'a break from thematic elements'
  - <br> - Line break, used for 'ungrouping' a piece of content, like a poem in a <p> tag, to be on different lines.
  - <sup> / <sub> - Superscript (like citations) and subscript (like scientific element abbreviations / fractions).
      <p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p> -- H2O

? Trivia: <div> is short for 'The Content Division Element'.

! HTTP Entities
* Special codes and symbols that are reserved for creating symbols or hard-to-type characters.
They all start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).
The browser interprets them and renders the correct character instead of what you actually typed.
They are also used for reserved symbols, such as a < or > that are used commonly in HTML and might be interpreted as such by VSCode and/or our browser.
? Typically there are two ways to declare these; an entity name or an entity number.

! Semantic Markup
? Answers the question - What purpose or role does that HTML element have?
The old-style was to just add divs, maybe with some identification in the class or id name.
These days, elements like <main>, <section>, <nav>, <header>, <footer> etc. gives us more clarity on what exactly we're looking at and what that section does.
* This markup gives our code meaning, allows search engines to better identify meaningful content, helps screen-readers for better accessibility, and makes it easier for ourselves and our devs to read.

? Let's look at some of these elements in more detail:

<main> - Used for, well, the main content, not the navbar, sidebar, anything repeatable, etc.
<nav> - Represents anything (like links) that provides navigation on our page and/or to other pages.
<section> - Simply shows that this part of your webpage is a standalone section of content. I.E. a section of content on a Wikipedia page.
<article> - Represents a self-contained composition in a document that is independently distributable or reusable; should have some kind of heading explaining what it is.
<aside> - Something that is indirectly related, a sidebar, for example.
<header> & <footer> - Self-explanatory (but can be used in sections of your page as well, not just the entire webpage)!
