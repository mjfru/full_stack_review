! Bootstrap
* As of writing, Bootstrap is on version 5.3 and the links to include in your HTML are as follows:
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

! Typography & Utilities in Bootstrap:
    - Display (display-1) - can change the size of headings (1-4)
    - Lead (lead) - Changes font size and weight of a selected text to be used as a tagline.
    - Blockquote (blockquote) - Represents quotation and changes the size and weight.
        - Footer (blockquote-footer) - Provides a way to provide information about the blockquote (-- Author, Date)
        - Alignment (text-center / text-right)

    - Color (text-primary / text-secondary) - Changes the text color
    - Background color (bg-primary / bg-success) - Self explanatory

! Badges, Alerts, & Button Groups
*    Badges - (badge) - Provide a small text blurb in a shape of your choosing (New! for example)
        - Can be customized with colors, shapes (pill), nested within buttons and other elements, and of course contains its own content.
?           <span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill>10+</span>

*   Button Groups - Groups multiple buttons together in a group; convenient for creating a group of options and a 'togetherness' of button elements.
?   <div class="btn-group>...</div>

* Alerts - Provides feedback to a user (a page has finished loading, payment successful, etc.)
?   <div class="alert alert-danger"> Danger! You're about to leave the page! </div>
    They are also dismissable!
    <button aria-label="Close" class="close">
        <span aria-hidden="true" data-dismiss="alert">&times</span>
    </button>

! Bootstrap Grid
* The grid system that comes baked into Bootstrap allows us to construct our own custom, responsive layouts.
? Every row in Bootstrap has -12- units of space to divide up.
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6 bg-success">I am 6 units</div>
        <div class="col-6 bg-danger">I am 6 units</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row>
        <div class="col-4 bg-danger">I am 4 units</div>
        <div class="col-2 bg-success">I am 2 units</div>
        <div class="col-6 bg-secondary">I am 6 units</div>
    </div>
* If you don't specify a numerical value for one or all of your columns, it will auto-configure for you.

! Reponsiveness with Bootstrap Grid
Bootstrap has some built-in sizes for responsiveness (sm, md, lg, etc.)
Example:    <div class="col-md-6 col-xl-3 bg-success></div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-xl-3 bg-success></div>
These will take up 6 units at medium breakpoints but 3 at extra large ones.

! Grid Utilities
* Essentially, we can use some flexbox properties to better align our grid to our liking by sticking those properties in the Bootstrap class.
? i.e. class="justify-content-center"
They can be used in tandem with our responsive Bootstrap grid as well.

! Bootstrap Forms
class="form-control" gives us stylized input forms, usually nested in a form-group div to hold labels and inputs togethers.
? Grid can also be used to customize how big / long these inputs are. I've been annoyed before by their sizing defaults and never realized this.
<div class="row">
    <div class="form-group col">
        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input type="email" class="form-control" id="email" placeholder="email">
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="password">Password</label>
        <input type="password" class="form-control" id="password" placeholder="password">
    </div>
</div>

* Form-row also exists and just changes the spacing a touch more than the standard 'row' class.

! Navbars
* While extremely common and convenient, there's quite a bit of syntax to recall; best to visit the docs rather than write up notes here.
However, these navbars make our lives a lot easier, our webpages responsive, and include some nice features right out of the box.

! Utilities
* Bootstrap offers lots of utilities to quick add CSS, such as border properties, spacing (with margin and padding), etc.

! Bootstrap Grab Bag
* Some other common features and useful aspects of Bootstrap are: content cards, carousel (image gallery/slider), dropdown menus, spinners, and modals (pop-up dialogues).
