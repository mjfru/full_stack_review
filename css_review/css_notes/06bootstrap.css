! Typography & Utilities in Bootstrap:

    - Lead (lead) - Changes font size and weight of a selected text to be used as a tagline.
    - Blockquote (blockquote) - Represents quotation and changes the size and weight.
        - Footer (blockquote-footer) - Provides a way to provide information about the blockquote (-- Author, Date)
        - Alignment (text-center / text-right)

    - Color (text-primary / text-secondary) - Changes the text color
    - Background color (bg-primary / bg-success) - Self explanatory

! Badges, Alerts, & Button Groups
*    Badges - (badge) - Provide a small text blurb in a shape of your choosing (New! for example)
        - Can be customized with colors, shapes (pill), nested within buttons and other elements, and of course contains its own content.
?           <span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill>10+</span>

*   Button Groups - Groups multiple buttons together in a group; convenient for creating a group of options and a 'togetherness' of button elements.
?   <div class="btn-group>...</div>

* Alerts - Provides feedback to a user (a page has finished loading, payment successful, etc.)
?   <div class="alert alert-danger"> Danger! You're about to leave the page! </div>
    They are also dismissable!
    <button aria-label="Close" class="close">
        <span aria-hidden="true" data-dismiss="alert">&times</span>
    </button>
