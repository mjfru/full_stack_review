! Terminal Commands Review
! (Only new or information I'd like to solidify will be contained here.)

? Why use the terminal?
  - Faster than using a GUI.
  - Access to areas of our PC we typically don't interact with.
  - Tools we need are used via the command line; not much of a choice otherwise.

* Terminals used to be a physical object but now it refers to the software terminal.
* A Shell is a program running on the terminal. (ATM vs. Software on an ATM)
* Bash - One of the most popular shells -- the default on Macs.

! Commands
  - ls - List the files in your current directory, the -a flag will display hidden files as well
  - ~ - Indicates your 'home' directory, likely your username for your PC name
  - pwd - Print working directory
  - cd - Change directory - cd / - takes you to your root directory
  - mkdir - Make a new directory/folder
  - man - Manual - Gives you information about terminal commands (i.e. man ls)
  - touch - Create a file (or multiple at once)
  - rm - Removes a file (or multiple) - Does NOT go to the trash bin, deleted directly.
    - Accepts two flags -rf (recursive force) removes everything in nested folders
