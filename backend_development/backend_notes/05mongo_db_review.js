! (Re)Introduction to Mongo DB
What is Mongo? - The Database we'll be using from here on out and one of the components of the -M-ERN stack.
* Mongo is a document database, commonly used in combination with Node.js, and allows us to store and retrieve complex data.

? Why use a database in the first place instead of just saving to a file?
  - Databases can handle large amounts of data efficiently and store it compactly.
  - They provide tools for easy insertion, querying, and updating of data.
  - They generally offer security features and control over access to data.
  - They (generally...and hopefully) scale well!

! Databases usually fall under two categories: SQL and NoSQL
* SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases; we pre-define a schema of tables before we insert anything.
  ? Examples: MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, Oracle, MS SQL
* NoSQL is well, the opposite and include document, key-value, and graph stores databases.
  ? Examples: MongoDB, Couch DB, Neo4j, Cassandra, Redis

! So, why Mongo DB?
  * Very commonly used with Node and Express (MEAN and MERN stacks)
  Easy to get started with
  Plays particularly well with JavaScript
  Its popularity also means there is a strong community of developers using Mongo.
