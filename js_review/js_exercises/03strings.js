/*
! String Variables Practice
Please define the following string variables (you can use either let or const):

bestColor should be set to the string purple 

quote should be set to the string You had me at "hello" - be careful about quotation marks, we want double quotes inside the string.
*/

let bestColor = "purple";

const quote = 'You had me at "hello"'
